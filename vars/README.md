# `vars` directory
In this directory you define functions in the global scope.

A file named `MyTest.groovy` will create a Groovy object in the global scope stored in the `MyTest` variable. If you
then define a `call` function in the file, MyTest will become a callable function. We provide an example in the
`MyTestFunction.groovy` file.
